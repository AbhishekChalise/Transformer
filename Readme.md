# Transformer Model Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a Transformer model, inspired by the "Attention is All You Need" paper. The project is modular, with separate components for embeddings, attention mechanisms, feed-forward networks, and more, making it easy to understand and extend.

## Project Structure



### Key Directories and Files

- **`models/`**: Contains the core components of the Transformer model, including attention mechanisms, embeddings, encoder, decoder, and feed-forward layers.
- **`training/`**: Includes scripts for training, evaluation, and scheduling.
- **`tests/`**: Unit tests for various components of the model.
- **`configs/`**: Configuration files for training and model setup.
- **`scripts/`**: Shell scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experimentation.

## Features

- **Multi-Head Attention**: Implemented in [`attention.py`](models/attention.py).
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Implemented in [`feedforward.py`](models/feedforward.py).
- **Layer Normalization**: Implemented in [`layers.py`](models/layers.py).
- **Embeddings and Positional Encoding**: Implemented in [`embeddings.py`](models/embeddings.py).
- **Encoder and Decoder**: Implemented in [`encoder.py`](models/encoder.py) and [`decoder.py`](models/decoder.py).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/transformer-model.git
   cd transformer-model

2.Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3.Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Running Tests
To ensure all components are working correctly, run the unit tests:
pytest tests/

Training
To train the model, use the train.sh script:
bash [train.sh](http://_vscodecontentref_/29)
